<h1>Twin Prime Conjecture</h1>

<p>Are there infinitely many primes \(p\) such that \(p+2\) is also prime.</p>
<h2>Proof to the Twin Prime Conjecture</h2>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>Let \(p_n\) be the nth prime number.</p>
<p>Let \(P_n\) be the multiplication of the first nth prime numbers.</p>
<h3>Structure of Proof</h3>
<h4>First Part</h4>
<p>\(a\) in \(A_n\) where \(a &lt; P_n\) and \(a\) relatively prime to \(P_n\)</p>
<p>There always exist two numbers which differ by 2 in each subsequent set \(A_n\) where \(n \geq 3\).</p>
<h4>Second Part</h4>
<p>There always exist two prime numbers which differ by d in each subsequent nth set of arithmetic progressions: \(\{mP_n+a\}\)
     where \(n \geq 2\) and \(a\) in \(A_n\) and \(a &lt; P_n\) and \(a\) relatively prime to \(P_n\) and \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\)</p>
<p>Creating set of pairs \(\{(m_1P_n+a_1,m_2P_n+a_2)\}\) where \(m_1=m_2\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\) and \(m_1P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(m_2P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) and \(0 \leq m < P_n\) 
</p>
<p>Therefore there are infinite number of primes \(p\) where \(p+2\) is alos prime.</p>
<h3>First part:</h3>

<p>\(a\) in \(A_n\) where \(a &lt; P_n\) and \(a\) relatively prime to \(P_n\)</p>
<p>There always exist two numbers which differ by 2 in each subsequent set \(A_n\) where \(n \geq 3\).</p>
<h4>Base Case</h4>
<p>The numbers \(11\) and \(13\) in \(A_3\)</p>
<h4>Induction Case</h4>
<p>A pair of numbers \((a_1,a_2)\) where \(a_1,a_2\) in \(A_n\) which differ by \(d\) and \(d>0\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\)
    will propagate at least \(p_{n+1}-2\) pairs of numbers \((b_1,b_2)\) where \(b_1,b_2\) in \(A_{n+1}\) which differ by \(d\) and \(b_1+d=b_2\)
</p>
<p>\(a\) in \(A_n\) generates \(p_{n+1}-1\) elements in \(A_{n+1}\) via arithmetic progression: \(\{mP_n+a\}\)
where \(0 \leq m &lt; p_{n+1}\) </p>
 <p>
    Unique value \(m_1P_n+a_1\) divisible by \(p_{n+1}\) in \(\{mP_n + a\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; p_{n+1}\)
</p>
<p>The unique value \(m_1P_n+a_1\) divisible by \(p_{n+1}\) in \(\{mP_n + a_1\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; p_{n+1}\)
and the unique value \(m_2P_n+a_2\) divisible by \(p_{n+1}\)in  \(\{mP_n + a_2\}\)  where \(0 \leq m &lt; p_{n+1}\) 
has two possible cases \(m_1 = m_2\) and \(m_1 \neq m_2\)</p>
<p>If \(m_1 = m_2\)<br/>
    Then a pair of numbers \((a_1,a_2)\) where \(a_1,a_2\) in \(A_n\) which differ by \(d\) and \(d>0\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\)
    will propagate \(p_{n+1}-1\) pairs of numbers \((b_1,b_2)\) where \(b_1,b_2\) in \(A_{n+1}\) which differ by \(d\) where \(b_1+d=b_2\)
</p>
<p>If \(m_1 \neq m_2\)<br/>
    Then a pair of numbers \((a_1,a_2)\) where \(a_1,a_2\) in \(A_n\) which differ by \(d\) and \(d>0\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\)
    will propagate \(p_{n+1}-2\) pairs of numbers \((b_1,b_2)\) where \(b_1,b_2\) in \(A_{n+1}\) which differ by \(d\) where \(b_1+d=b_2\)
</p>
    
<h3>Second part:</h3>

<p>There always exist two prime numbers which differ by d in each subsequent nth set of arithmetic progressions: \(\{mP_n+a\}\)
     where \(n \geq 2\) and \(a\) in \(A_n\) and \(a &lt; P_n\) and \(a\) relatively prime to \(P_n\) and \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\)</p>
<p>Creating set of pairs \(\{(m_1P_n+a_1,m_2P_n+a_2)\}\) where \(m_1=m_2\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\) and \(m_1P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(m_2P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) and \(0 \leq m < P_n\) </p>


<p> If \(c\) in \(\{mP_n+a\}\) is a composite where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\) 
    then \(c = xo\) where \(x &gt; 0\) and \(o\) is odd and \(3 \leq o \leq (P_n-1)\)
    because the largest value in \(\{mP_n+a\}\) is \((P_n-1)P_n+P_n-1=(P_n-1)(P_n+1)\)
</p>

<p>The concrete example of finding composite elements in \(\{mP_n+a\}\) where \(a &lt; P_n\) and a relatively prime to \(P_n\) and \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\)</p>
<p>Choose \(n=3\) and \(11,13\) in \(A_3\) for \(\{mP_3+11\}\) and \(\{mP_3+11\}\) and \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\)</p>
<p>\(\{mP_3+11\} = 11,41,71,101,131,161,191,221,251,281,311,341,371,401,431,461,491,521,551,581,611,641,671,701,731,761,791,821,851,881\)</p>
<p>If \(c\) in \(\{mP_3+11\}\) is a composite where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\) 
    then \(c= xo\) where \(x &gt; 0\) and \(o\) in \(\{7,11,13,17,19,23,29\}\)
    </p>
<p>numbers divisible by 7: 161,371,581,791</p>
<p>numbers divisible by 11: 11,341, 671</p>
<p>numbers divisible by 13: 221, 611</p>
<p>numbers divisible by 17: 221,731</p>
<p>numbers divisible by 19: 551</p>
<p>numbers divisible by 23: </p>
<p>numbers divisible by 29: 551</p>
<p>It is possible to determine a prime number exist in \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\)
    without calculating this set of numbers: \(\{161,371,581,791,11,341, 671, 221, 611,221,731,551,551\}\)?</p>

<p>Make a mask for composite number divisible by 29 for \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\).
  <br/>
  Doing the calculation we know there exist only one composite divisible by 29: \(551=18 \times P_3 + 11\).
  <br/>
  But we do not have this luxury.
  <br/>
  All we know now is that in 29 consective elements of \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where \(x \leq m &lt; (x+29)\). 
  There is either unique \(m_1P_3+11\) divisible by 29 or
  all 29 consective elements are not divisible by 29.
   <br/>
    Assume worst case scenario there exist two numbers divisible by 29 in \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\).
    <br/>
    Assume \(0 \times P_3+11\) and \(29 \times P_3+11\) are divisible by 29.
    <br/>
    Assume \(m \times P_3+11\) where \(0 &lt; m &lt; 29\) are not divisible by 29.
    <br/>
    It is like adjusting 30 numbers between 551 and 1421 in \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where 551 and 1421 are actually divisible by 29: \(551=18 \times P_3 + 11\) and \(1421=(18 + 29) \times P_3 + 11\).
    <br/>
    \(11 = 551-540 , 41 = 581-540, 71 = 611-540, 101 = 641-540, \ldots\)</p>
<p>Combining 2 mask for composite number divisible by 29  for \(\{mP_3+11\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\) and  for \(\{mP_3+13\}\) where \(0 \leq m &lt; P_3\).
    <br/>
    
  All we know now is that in 29 consective elements of \(\{mP_3+13\}\) where \(x \leq m &lt; (x+29)\). 
  There is either unique \(m_1P_3+13\) divisible by 29 or
  all 29 consective elements are not divisible by 29.
  <br/>
    Assume worst case scenario there is unique \(m_1P_n+13\) divisible by 29 in \(\{mP_3+13\}\) where \(x \leq m &lt; (P_3-1+x\) 

   <br/>
   and \(m_1 \neq 0\) and \(m_1 \neq 29\) where we assume \(0 \times P_3+11\) and \(29 \times P_3+11\) are divisible by 29.

</p>
<p>
    Base Case:
    <br/>
    Now we can say of pairs \(\{(m_1P_n+a_1,m_2P_n+a_2)\}\) where \(m_1=m_2\) and \(a_1+d=a_2\) and \(m_1P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(m_2P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) and \(0 \leq m &lt; P_n\) ,
    <br/>
    There must exist at least 27 pairs of \(\{(m_1P_n+a_1,m_2P_n+a_2)\}\) 
    where both numbers in the pair are not divisible by 29.

</p>

<p>Induction:
<br/>
All composites in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\) must be divisible by an odd number greater than or equal to \(3\) and less than or equal to \(P_n-1\).  
<br/>
All composites in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) must be divisible by an odd number greater than or equal to \(3\) and less than or equal to \(P_n-1\).

<br/>

If there exist \(m_1P_n+a_1\) in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\) such that \(m_1P_n+a_1\) is divisible by \(f\) 
<br/>
Then this is the set \(\{(m_1+xf)P_n+a_1\}\) of all elements divisible by \(f\) in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\)
<br/>
If there exist \(m_2P_n+a_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) such that \(m_2P_n+a_2\) is divisible by \(f\) 
<br/>
Then this is the set \(\{(m_2+xf)P_n+a_2\}\) of all elements divisible by \(f\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\)

<br/>

Take \(P_n-1\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1)\)
<br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_1P_n+a_1\) divisible by \((P_n-1)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\).
<br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_2P_n+a_2\) divisible by \((P_n-1)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\).
<br/>
Leaving \(P_n-1-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1)\)
<br/>
Assume the remaining \(P_n-1-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1\) are sequential.
<br/>
Therefore there exist \(P_n-1-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1-2)\).
 <br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_1P_n+a_1\) divisible by \((P_n-1-2)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\).
<br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_2P_n+a_2\) divisible by \((P_n-1-2)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\).
<br/>
Leaving \(P_n-1-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1-2\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1-2)\)
<br/>
Assume the remaining \(P_n-1-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1-2\) are sequential.
<br/>
Therefore there exist \(P_n-1-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1-2-2)\).
<br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_1P_n+a_1\) divisible by \((P_n-1-2-2)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_1\}\).
<br/>
Assume there is unique \(m_2P_n+a_2\) divisible by \((P_n-1-2-2)\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\).
<br/>
Leaving \(P_n-1-2-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1-2-2\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1-2-2)\)
<br/>
Assume the remaining \(P_n-1-2-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(P_n-1-2-2\) are sequential.
<br/>
Therefore there exist \(P_n-1-2-2-2\) pairs of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+P_n-1-2-2-2)\).

<br/>
\(\dots\)
<br/>

Leaving \(1\) pair of numbers \(\{(q_1,q_2)\}\) not divisible by \(3\) where  \(q_1\) in \(\{mP_n +a_1\}\) and \(q_2\) in \(\{mP_n+a_2\}\) where \((x) \leq m &lt; (x+1)\).

Therefore \(q_1,q_2\) must be both prime numbers.
